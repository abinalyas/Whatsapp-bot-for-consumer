# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the existing single-tenant WhatsApp booking bot POC into a production-ready, multi-tenant SaaS platform that allows multiple businesses to independently manage their own WhatsApp booking systems. The platform will provide complete data isolation, automated onboarding, and dynamic bot configuration capabilities while maintaining the core booking functionality that has been proven in the POC.
